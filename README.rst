Petgram: a photo app for your pets!
==================================


This is a FastAPI + PostgreSQL sample app. So far it only has login, logout and sign in functionality, but the plan is to allow users to upload pictures that support comments and likes. 

To get it set up in a dev container in VS Code, you can:

- `Check your system requirements and set up your machine <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started>`_ 

- Clone this project to your machine and open the folder in VS Code.

- Open the command palette (View > Command Palette...) and run the " Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container" command.
